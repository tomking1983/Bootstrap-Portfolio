# Module 3 Challenge -  Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

### Notes

After creating a simple portfolio in module 2 I had started working on my very own version of my portfolio that I would use once graduated from this course, as such I have used much of the design and elements from this work that I have been doing in my own time. I had already incorporated elements of Bootstrap into this portfolio work.

My portfolio is live on the web and can be seen by visiting [www.tomianking.co.uk](https://www.tomianking.co.uk/)

This portfolio shall evolve as I make my way through this Bootcamp course and learn new technologies along the way.
